				<p class="info">At college, Ross trained for a career in paleontology (on a dare), completing his Ph.D. He later became employed at the New York Museum of Prehistoric History. At one time, Ross claims to have, "given up a career in basketball," to become a paleontologist. He also claims that he would have been good at advertising and that he invented the phrase, "Got Milk?" After Monica questions this claim, Ross turns to Joey and mentions that he, "should have written it down." He also claims to have had the idea for Jurassic Park and Die Hard stolen from him.</p>

				<p class="info">Ross' scientific commentaries aren't always very well received. Most of his papers on sediment flow rates are supposedly widely discredited, and he only gets negative publications in scientific journals. But he is invited as a keynote speaker at a paleontology conference, where he delivers a very-well received talk, implying that there are people who agree with his ideas.</p>
